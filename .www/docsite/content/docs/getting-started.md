Welcome! Thank you for your interest in `torque`! This guide will help you get started with `torque` and show you how to use it to build your own web applications.

## Installation {#installation}

```shell
go get github.com/tylermmorton/torque@latest
```

## Hello World {#hello-world}

To get a torque app up and running, you need to create a `Router` and start the server.

At its core `torque` is just a router compatible with Go‚Äôs standard `net/http` package. There's no magic here. The router implements `http.Handler` so it can be used directly when serving:

```go
package main

import (
    "net/http"

    "github.com/tylermmorton/torque"
)

func main() {
    r := torque.NewRouter()

    http.ListenAndServe("localhost:9001", r)
}
```

You may notice that `NewRouter` takes a variadic list of `Route` arguments. You can compose your application at startup this way:

```go
package main

import (
    "net/http"

    "github.com/tylermmorton/torque"
)

func main() {
    r := torque.NewRouter(
        torque.WithHandler("/",
            // register a plain ol' http.HandlerFunc to the / route
            http.HandlerFunc(func(wr http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
                wr.Write([]byte("Hello, world!"))
                wr.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
            }),
        ),
    )

    http.ListenAndServe("localhost:9001", r)
}
```

Registering an `http.HandlerFunc` is the ultimate flexibility and it‚Äôs not much different than using `net/http` directly. `torque` offers a series of additional components used for composition:
